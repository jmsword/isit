				<h3>iSIT's Story</h3>
		
				<p>iSIT is an acronym for “I am a Student Inspiring Transformation.” The original definition 
				of the word “inspire” means “to breathe life into.” By “breathing life into” our own transformative 
				process, we breathe life into others’ as well.</p> 
			
				<p>Networks of student-led mindfulness and meditation groups at universities across the U.S. were 
				invited to join together to co-create an online community and forum where we could connect and discuss 
				with one another the work we are each doing on our campuses.</p>
			
				<p>The heart of iSIT explores the process of self-transformation, fosters ongoing curiosity, and questions what it means to be “whole.” For thousands of years, Eastern traditions have 
				practiced the art of meditation and holistic health as means of cultivating wisdom, compassion, and longevity. These practices are gradually being embraced by Western culture, both 
				socially and scientifically. This movement invites students to co-create a presence on college campuses that embody a mindful shift in awareness. Practicing mindfulness with the support 
				of one another will inspire the emergence of non-judgmental observation that supplements our internal wisdom. It is the very act of choosing to change that empowers us to practice such 
				methods of mindful reflection and compassion meditation for self and others.</p>			
			
				<p>College is a time for learning. Students’ learning should extend beyond academics, and explore the inner depths of the human experience: 
				What are my core values? Who am I? What do I want to contribute to the world? How can I be a better 
				human being? How can I truly be happy?</p>
			
				<p>Even though much of meditation stems from Eastern traditions, iSIT has taken a non-denominational approach to reach a 
				larger audience. This movement extends beyond religious and cultural boundaries so that it may respond to the universal 
				needs of humans.</p>

						so this group has only helped to enhance and fine-tune mine even more.”</span> –Nikki, 20, University of San Diego</p></a>

						calm space to allow me to really focus on class instruction, information recall for tests, and overall academic performance. We learn how to focus on our own strengths and weaknesses 
						while participating in a community in an effort to improve not just ourselves, but also that community.”</span> –Stacy, 26, University of San Diego</p></a>
