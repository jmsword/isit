				<h3><a href="testimonies.php">What Do iSIT For?</a></h3>
		
				<p>The iSIT movement raises awareness about the benefits of mindfulness and meditation practice for college students.</p>
			
				<p>The practices of meditation, mindfulness, and compassion training are greatly needed for students 
				in the high-stress university environment. Student mental health is becoming increasingly worse. Today there are
				typically two options for students who experience stress and anxiety, or struggle with ADHD or depression: medication or counseling services.
				Research indicates that meditation and mindfulness practice can be a positive alternative to these more traditional,
				and sometimes limiting, options. Together, we can help each other develop quality meditation and mindfulness groups that 
				are conducive for improving the well-being of college students. iSIT, as an ongoing process of learning, is working 
				to empower students to take control of their issues by bringing themselves to these group practices.</p>

				<p>We invite you to be a part of the iSIT movement!</p>
