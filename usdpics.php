					<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Hiking with Mindfulness</span> event provided students the opportunity to experience meditating in nature. Every few miles, we paused to practice 
					a guided exercise that enhanced our connection to the surrounding environment. At the peak (shown here), we meditated in silence and found a 
					boundless stillness that made for a truly unique experience! Spring 2015</p>

					<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Sundays</span> is a once-a-month ceremony that gives students time to gather together at Sunset Cliffs in honor of celebrating each of our practices 
					as individuals and as a greater whole. The gathering consists of a variety of meditations that support our courage to transform ourselves into becoming 
					more connected, compassionate, and aware beings. Fall 2015</p>

					<p>On our final <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Sunday</span> of the semester, we sat together in meditation as an incredible sunset painted the sky and afterwards, we released 7 sky 
					lanterns that held our written intentions for bringing peace to ourselves and to our communities in 2016.</p>

					<p>iSIT at USD has started offering meditation as "service" for student organizations on campus. <span style="font-style:italic;">FUSO</span>, the 
					<span style="font-style:italic;">Filipino Ugnayan Student Organization</span>, is one of the largest groups on campus and prides themselves on their 
					family-like community. iSIT was invited to give a self-compassion meditation at one of their meetings that was featuring the benefits of self-care. 
					It was an emotional, but impactful session that allowed FUSO members to understand how to better care for themselves by turning inward. Fall 2015</p>
